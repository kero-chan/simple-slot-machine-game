# 🟡 Golden Tiles Feature - Mahjong Ways

## **What Are Golden Tiles?**

Golden tiles are **regular symbol tiles that appear with a golden/glowing background** during gameplay. They look like normal mahjong tiles but have a distinctive golden glow or golden pot symbol overlay.

---

## **Where Do They Appear?**

- **Only on Reels 2, 3, and 4** (the middle three reels)
- Any regular symbol can become golden (EXCEPT Wild and Scatter symbols)
- They appear randomly during spins
- Cannot appear on reel 1 or reel 5

---

## **How Do They Work?**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **During the spin**: Regular symbols on reels 2, 3, or 4 may appear with a golden background

2. **After winning combinations are formed and removed**: One or more golden symbols may be visible on the grid

3. **Random transformation**: After the cascade (when symbols fall down), **one randomly selected golden symbol transforms into a WILD symbol**

4. **New winning check**: The newly transformed Wild can create additional winning combinations

5. **Cascade continues**: If new wins are formed, the cascade mechanic continues with increasing multipliers
